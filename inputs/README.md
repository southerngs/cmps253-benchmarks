#Input Sets

Some of the benchmarks use input sets generated with the fasta algorithm (using the fasta benchmark).
The resulting input sets are too large to keep in the git repository.  The simplest thing
to do is generate them locally after checking out the respository.

This directory contains a copy of the fastest C implementation for generating the input files 
and a script to generate them for various different sizes.
